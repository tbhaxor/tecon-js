#  Rules To Be Strictly Followed
1. Don't commit changes to _master_ branch, rather check _How to Work as a Contributor_ [here](#how-to-work-as-a-contributor)
2. [_OPTIONAL_]: Code must be commented
3. Pull request should pass all tests

# How to Work as a Contributor
1. Create a branch at local repository
```
 git checkout -b <enter_branch_name>
```
2. Commit all the changes to current branches
3. Test and run
4. Finally, when everything is done push the current branch to _origin_
```
git push origin <enter_branch_name>
```
5. Compare and create new pull request
